This addition gives the support for Embarcadero Delphi 11 to ZeosLib, changed the LibSuffix from 270 to 280 for Delphi 11. 
Why I put this stuff to github but not to sourceforge.net?
 I currently have difficulty while registering to sourceforge.net.


## What is to be done?
Create subdirectory "DelphiXE11" in the directory "packages" of the original ZeosLib and copy my files there.
That is all, futher use usual procedure, starting with ZeosDbo.groupproj and so on...
